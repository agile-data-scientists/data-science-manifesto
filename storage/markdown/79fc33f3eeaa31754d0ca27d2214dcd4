<p><em>Prior</em> to building a model, construct an evaluation framework with end-to-end business focused acceptance criteria.</p>

<p>All validation of data, hypotheses and performance of models must be tracked, reviewed and automated.</p>

<p>Even research can be broken down into clearly defined tasks. The smallest of iterations should be preferred in acquiring, integrating and correcting knowledge.</p>
