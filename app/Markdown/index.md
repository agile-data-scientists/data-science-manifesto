Here we clarify the application of both the Scientific and [Agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) Methodologies to Data Science.  
*Agile Data Science* incrementally delivers clean, transparent and composable data-driven products by valuing:

 - **Minimal Viable Products** over prototypes
 - **APIs** over databases
 - **Clever use of computation** over convenient assumptions
 - **Dashboards** over reports
 - **Scrutinized repeatable hypothesis validation** over conventions and ad verecundiams

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
