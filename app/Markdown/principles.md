*Prior* to building a model, construct an evaluation framework with end-to-end business focused acceptance criteria.

All validation of data, hypotheses and performance of models must be tracked, reviewed and automated.

Donâ€™t neglect assumptions in models. Make them explicit then aim to have them either verified or removed.

Even research can be broken down into clearly defined tasks. The smallest of iterations should be preferred in acquiring, integrating and correcting knowledge.
